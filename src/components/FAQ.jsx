    question: 'Do you only arrange trips inside Bangladesh?',
    answer:
      'Yes — TripNest is fully focused on domestic travel. We don\'t book international trips or flights, so every package you see is somewhere within Bangladesh.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do we get to the destination — is transport included?',
    answer:
      'Most packages include return transport from a set pickup point (usually Dhaka) by bus, CNG, or boat depending on the destination. This is mentioned clearly on each package page before you book.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What\'s included in the package price?',
    answer:
      'Transport, accommodation, and the listed activities are included. Meals are included where mentioned — some packages leave meals flexible so you can choose local spots yourself.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it safe to travel to hill or forest areas like Bandarban or Sundarbans?',
    answer:
      'Yes — these routes are travelled regularly with local guides who know the area well. We share safety guidelines and required permits (where applicable) before departure.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I book for a family or a large group?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. Just select your group size while booking — for groups larger than 10, message us directly and we\'ll arrange suitable transport and rooming.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to pay the full amount upfront?',
    answer:
      'No — most packages can be confirmed with a partial advance payment. The remaining balance is settled before or during the trip, as shown at checkout.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if the weather turns bad during the trip?',
    answer:
      'For weather-sensitive routes (hill tracks, river trips), we monitor forecasts closely and will reschedule or adjust the itinerary for your safety — you won\'t lose your booking over it.',
  },
